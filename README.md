## Q3
The social media application that I chose was Instagram, and the part that I will be discussing is the comment posting functionality. Here is my TDD approach:
- Create a test to see if the number of comments on a post has increased
- Implement code to add a Lorem Ipsum comment to the list of comments associated with a post when "comment" button is pressed
- Create a test to see if the newest comment on a post matches the inputted comment
- Implement code to add a user-submitted comment to the list of comments associated with a post when the "comment" button is pressed
- Create a test to assert failure if comment is longer than 255 characters
- Implement code to prevent users from entering more than 255 characters on the client side when writing a comment
